# test for series of binary constraints
# four unconstrained tasks that are all before a final task
task wall1 10
task wall2 15
task wall3 12
task wall4 10
task roof 20
# binary constraints
constraint wall1 before roof
constraint wall2 before roof
constraint roof after wall3 
constraint roof after wall4
constraint wall1 equals wall4
constraint wall3 during wall2
# domain constraints
domain wall1 starts-after 5
domain wall3 ends-in 45 50
domain roof starts-after 10
