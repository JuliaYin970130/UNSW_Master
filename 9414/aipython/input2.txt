# test for series of domain constraints
# four unconstrained tasks that are all before a final task
task wall1 10
task wall2 15
task wall3 15
task wall4 10
task roof 20
# binary constraints
constraint wall1 before roof
constraint roof after wall2
constraint wall3 before roof
constraint roof after wall4
# domain constraints
domain wall1 starts-after 5
domain wall2 between 10 30
domain wall3 ends-in 45 50
domain wall4 ends-before 60
domain roof starts-after 10
